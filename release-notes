version 0.9.7
=================

New features
------------
 * Configuration file: it has been introduced a configuration file, namely csparql.properties. The file contains setting to enable/disable features of the C-SPARQL engine. At the moment, it is used for the External time clock feature (see next point). There is a default configuration that is loaded by default. Users interested in using a different configuration, should place the csparql.properties file in the folder where C-SPARQL is executed.
 * External time clock: the clock of C-SPARQL can now be controlled externally, i.e., it can use the time instants in the streams instead of the internal clock of Esper. The functionality is disabled by default, but it can be enabled through the csparql.properties file (an example file is provided). The feature inherits some open bugs from C-SPARQL (see Known Issues section)

Notes
-----
 * POM files: POM files have been restructured. Now the parent POM does not depend anymore on its modules. 
 * The CSPARQL-ui project has been extended in order to generate a jar with all dependencies. By default, the eu.larkc.csparql.ui.Application class is run
 * Licensing: TBD(dani)
